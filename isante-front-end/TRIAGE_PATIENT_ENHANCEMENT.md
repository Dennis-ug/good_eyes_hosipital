# Triage Response Enhancement - Patient Details Added

## Overview
Enhanced the triage measurement response to include patient details (name and phone number) for better context and usability.

## Changes Made

### 1. TriageMeasurementDto.java
- Added `patientName` field (String)
- Added `patientPhone` field (String)
- Updated constructor to populate patient details from visit session

### 2. TriageMeasurementRepository.java
- Added `findByVisitSessionIdWithPatient()` with fetch joins
- Added `findAllWithPatientDetails()` with fetch joins  
- Added `findByIdWithPatient()` with fetch joins
- Kept legacy methods for backward compatibility

### 3. TriageMeasurementService.java
- Updated methods to use new repository methods with patient details
- Ensures patient data is loaded efficiently with fetch joins

## Response Format

### Before
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "visitSessionId": 1,
  "systolicBp": 120,
  "diastolicBp": 80,
  "rbsValue": 45.0,
  "rbsUnit": "mg/dL",
  "iopRight": 0,
  "iopLeft": 0,
  "weightKg": 56.0,
  "weightLbs": null,
  "notes": "test",
  "measuredBy": null,
  "measurementDate": "2025-08-11T13:08:14.488",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-11T16:09:14.254304",
  "updatedAt": "2025-08-11T16:09:14.246714",
  "createdBy": "superadmin",
  "updatedBy": "superadmin"
}
```

### After
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "visitSessionId": 1,
  "systolicBp": 120,
  "diastolicBp": 80,
  "rbsValue": 45.0,
  "rbsUnit": "mg/dL",
  "iopRight": 0,
  "iopLeft": 0,
  "weightKg": 56.0,
  "weightLbs": null,
  "notes": "test",
  "measuredBy": null,
  "measurementDate": "2025-08-11T13:08:14.488",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-11T16:09:14.254304",
  "updatedAt": "2025-08-11T16:09:14.246714",
  "createdBy": "superadmin",
  "updatedBy": "superadmin",
  "patientName": "John Doe",
  "patientPhone": "1234567890"
}
```

## API Endpoints Affected
- `GET /api/triage-measurements/{id}` - Now includes patient details
- `GET /api/triage-measurements/visit-session/{visitSessionId}` - Now includes patient details
- `GET /api/triage-measurements` - Now includes patient details for all records

## Performance Considerations
- Uses fetch joins to load patient data efficiently
- No additional database queries needed
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Testing
Use the provided test script to verify patient details are included:
```bash
./test-triage-patient.sh
```

## Frontend Integration
The frontend can now display patient information directly from triage responses without additional API calls.

## Status
âœ… Implemented and ready for testing
