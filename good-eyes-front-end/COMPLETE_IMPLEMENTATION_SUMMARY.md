## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Enhanced Patient Visit Workflow
1. **RECEPTION** → Patient registered
2. **CASHIER** → Payment processed  
3. **TRIAGE** → Vital signs measured
4. **BASIC_REFRACTION_EXAM** → Basic refraction examination ← **NEW STAGE**
5. **DOCTOR_VISIT** → Doctor examination
6. **PHARMACY** → Medication dispensed
7. **COMPLETED** → Visit finished

### Automatic Stage Progression
- ✅ Payment validation before triage
- ✅ Triage completion required for basic refraction
