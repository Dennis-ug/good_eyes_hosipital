# Patient Deletion Error Solution

## Problem
When trying to delete a patient, you get this error:
```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Data Integrity Violation",
  "message": "Cannot delete this resource because it has related data.",
  "path": "uri=/api/patients",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-08 10:58:11"
}
```

## Root Cause
The patient has related data in the database that prevents deletion due to foreign key constraints:
- **Patient Visit Sessions**: Records of patient visits
- **Eye Examinations**: Medical examination records
- **Invoices**: Financial records linked to the patient

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Patient Entity**
Added relationship to PatientVisitSession:
```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "patient", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private List<PatientVisitSession> patientVisitSessions = new ArrayList<>();
```

### 2. **Improved Delete Method**
The `deletePatient` method now:
- Checks for related data before attempting deletion
- Provides detailed information about what related data exists
- Throws a descriptive error message

### 3. **Better Error Messages**
Instead of a generic error, you now get specific information:
```
"Cannot delete this resource because it has related data: Visit sessions (3), Eye examinations (2)"
```

## How to Handle This

### Option 1: Delete Related Data First
1. **Delete Visit Sessions**: Remove all patient visit records
2. **Delete Eye Examinations**: Remove all examination records
3. **Delete Invoices**: Remove all financial records
4. **Then delete the patient**

### Option 2: Use Soft Delete
Instead of hard deletion, mark the patient as inactive:
```java
patient.setActive(false);
patientRepository.save(patient);
```

### Option 3: Cascade Delete (Dangerous)
If you want to delete everything related to the patient:
```java
// This will delete all related data
patientRepository.deleteById(id);
```

## API Endpoints for Related Data

### Delete Visit Sessions
```http
DELETE /api/patient-visit-sessions/{id}
```

### Delete Eye Examinations
```http
DELETE /api/eye-examinations/{id}
```

### Get Patient's Related Data
```http
GET /api/patients/{id}/visit-sessions
GET /api/patients/{id}/eye-examinations
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Check Before Delete**
Always check for related data before attempting deletion.

### 2. **Use Soft Delete**
Consider using soft delete (mark as inactive) instead of hard delete.

### 3. **Cascade Options**
Configure cascade options in JPA relationships:
- `CascadeType.REMOVE`: Automatically delete related entities
- `CascadeType.ALL`: All operations cascade
- `CascadeType.NONE`: No cascade (current setup)

### 4. **Audit Trail**
Keep audit trail of deletions for compliance.

## Current Status

✅ **Enhanced error handling implemented**
✅ **Detailed error messages added**
✅ **Relationship mapping updated**
✅ **Data integrity protection active**

The system now provides clear information about why a patient cannot be deleted and what related data needs to be handled first.
