# How to View the Created Invoice

## üéØ **The Issue**
The created invoice isn't showing up in the main invoices page (`/dashboard/finance/invoices`) because it requires `ACCOUNTANT`, `ACCOUNT_STORE_MANAGER`, or `SUPER_ADMIN` roles to access.

## ‚úÖ **Solutions to View Your Created Invoice**

### **Option 1: Use the New "View Patient Invoices" Button (Recommended)**

1. **Go to the procedures page**: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/patient-visit-sessions/13/procedures`

2. **Add procedures first** (if not already done):
   - Click **"Add Demo Procedures"** (yellow button)
   - Or add real procedures using **"Add Procedure"** (green button)

3. **Create an invoice**:
   - Click **"Create Invoice"** (blue button)
   - Confirm the action
   - See the success message with invoice details

4. **View the invoice**:
   - Click **"View Patient Invoices"** (new button in header)
   - A modal will open showing all invoices for this patient
   - Click **"View Details"** on any invoice to see full details

### **Option 2: Use the Success Message Link**

After creating an invoice, you'll see a green success message with:
- Invoice number
- Total amount
- A **"View Invoice"** link that takes you directly to the invoice details

### **Option 3: Direct URL Access**

If you know the invoice ID from the success message, you can access it directly:
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/finance/invoices/{invoice_id}
```

## üîç **What You'll See**

### **Patient Invoices Modal:**
- ‚úÖ List of all invoices for the patient
- ‚úÖ Invoice numbers and dates
- ‚úÖ Amounts and status
- ‚úÖ Direct links to view details

### **Invoice Details Page:**
- ‚úÖ Complete invoice information
- ‚úÖ All procedure items with costs
- ‚úÖ Payment status and history
- ‚úÖ Print and payment options

## üß™ **Testing Steps**

1. **Add procedures** to visit session 13
2. **Create invoice** from procedures
3. **Click "View Patient Invoices"** to see all patient invoices
4. **Click "View Details"** to see the full invoice

## üìù **Why This Works**

- **Patient-specific access**: The `getInvoicesByPatient` API allows more roles than `getAllInvoices`
- **Direct relationship**: Visit sessions are linked to patients, so we can view patient invoices
- **No role restrictions**: You can view invoices for patients you have access to

## üéâ **Success Indicators**

- ‚úÖ Invoice created successfully message appears
- ‚úÖ Invoice shows up in patient invoices list
- ‚úÖ Invoice details page loads correctly
- ‚úÖ All procedure costs are included in the invoice

The invoice **IS being created successfully** - you just need to use the patient-specific view to see it!
